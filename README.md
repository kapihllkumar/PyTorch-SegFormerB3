# SegFormer-B3: Semantic Segmentation

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project delivers a **from-scratch implementation** of **SegFormer-B3**, a cutting-edge transformer-based model designed for semantic segmentation. Developed entirely in **PyTorch**.

**Key Highlights:**
- 🛠️ **Custom SegFormer-B3 architecture** built from the ground up  
- 🧪 **End-to-end training pipeline** with configurable hyperparameters  
- ⚡ **Optimized inference module** for efficient segmentation  
- 🌐 **Flask-based web application** for interactive testing and visualization

Whether you're studying transformer-based vision models or building production-level land cover classifiers, this implementation provides an educational yet practical foundation.

## 🗂 Dataset

We used the **DeepGlobe Land Cover Classification Dataset**, a collection of high-resolution satellite images annotated for terrain segmentation. It’s well-suited for distinguishing land types such as:
